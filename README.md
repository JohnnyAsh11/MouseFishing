# MouseFishing
---
## Description 

### MouseFishing is my second game made with the Unity game engine.  MouseFishing was primarily created with the intent to test and play with steering algorithms and innovates on code I wrote for my first Unity game.  This project was developed for a class assignment and uses many of the concepts taught in class.  I was the only developer for this project and sought to secure a stronger understanding of the composite design pattern in game engines for future projects such as developing my own game engine and developing more games within a game engine space.
